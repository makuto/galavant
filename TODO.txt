Soak test editor - after ~1 hour it was looking pretty glitchy

statics don't work well with hot reloading
	Need some sort of system which makes it easy to tell static shit to reload?

What does agent component manager do with triggers once plan is done? How to know plan is done?

Pickups sort of working, sometimes they aren't picked up, Actors are being destroyed strangely
	Possibility that pickup actor is falling through the floor (invisible other component hitting KillZ?) YES, it's KillZ

Minimap
	HUD Minimap is difficult to use with regards to rotation (needs better view cone)
	Minimap noise doesn't match world
		Scaling is completely wrong between WorldResource position and noise sample
			Actually, this doesn't seem to be the problem

Some sort of resource system
	Could be something like ResourceDictionary<key, ResourceType> resources
	then things could stuff in things from load or even hard coded (via resources["new thing"] = {})

Put HTN Tasks etc. in resource dictionaries? Who owns them?

Chunks are fucked

HUD Minimap rotation indicator doesn't work right when pitching the camera

Added coloring for errors, but I'm not sure it works

Added UnrealMovementComponent Actor/Character spawning
	First time you run the game or after hotreload it doesn't spawn anyone
	This seems to have gone away

Added TrackActorLifetime, which is untested
	Is this executed when pending kills will be sitting around, or right after cleanup?

Added EntityPlayerSharedData, which is untested

Added Interact to player, but does not seem to work
