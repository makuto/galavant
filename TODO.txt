Todo
------------------

Soak test editor - after ~1 hour it was looking pretty glitchy

statics don't work well with hot reloading
	Need some sort of system which makes it easy to tell static shit to reload?

What does agent component manager do with triggers once plan is done? How to know plan is done?

Pickups sort of working, sometimes they aren't picked up, Actors are being destroyed strangely
	Possibility that pickup actor is falling through the floor (invisible other component hitting KillZ?) YES, it's KillZ

Minimap
	HUD Minimap is difficult to use with regards to rotation (needs better view cone)
		Instead of doing this weird shit, just render the world and have UI create icons for player 
		 and things
	Minimap noise doesn't match world
		Scaling is completely wrong between WorldResource position and noise sample
			Actually, this doesn't seem to be the problem

Some sort of resource system
	Could be something like ResourceDictionary<key, ResourceType> resources
	 then things could stuff in things from load or even hard coded (via resources["new thing"] = {})

Put HTN Tasks etc. in resource dictionaries? Who owns them?


Position vs GlobalPosition
	As soon as possible, I need to decide if I need Chunk XYZ with Position XYZ
	This depends on whether I ever want to support really large worlds
		How large? I'd have to do the math (yes, the monster math)

Combat System
	Input
		Make callbacks in player character which talk to combat system/do things. For now, maybe
	     make this step control timing and pull it out into combat later
	Animations
		This is going to be tricky. Procedural would be cool, but difficult. At least shoot for
		 procedural impact effects
		Figure out how to actually make animations in Blender (try Unreal .fbx export/import)
			Note on .fbx import/export: I had to add the following to SSlateFileOpenDlg::GetFilterExtension:
				if (!FilterExt)
					return false;
				(this is fixed on 4.17 now)
		Could do UI only for now to experiment with timing
		Hook up ragdoll physics for deaths/unconscious
	Sound
		Can start with simple sounds: blood hit, sword hit/parry, sword swing
	Milestones
		Goal #1: Minecraft-quality
		Goal #2: Minecraft but with strategy (this can be the stopping point for now)
		Goal #3: Something closer to Chivalry instead of Minecraft

Seemed to see multiple actors spawned for a single berry

Massive convenience feature: Fuck, totally forgot as I was writing this. Fuck! 
	Was it Entity Actor integration?

Add player HUD UI - Only needs Minimap, Need bars

Actually important: Put Entity integration into AActor!

Doing
------------------

Combat

Agent goals are broken after refactor

Segfault every time you replay in editor on scene component thing

Remember to put Galavant-specific UE code into a patch or something

------------------
Done
------------------

Sublime "syntax" tag for build systems

Test PlanComponent event stuff
	It seems to have broken things

Logging broke as shit
	https://answers.unrealengine.com/questions/435366/linux-crash-in-stdstring-destructor.html ?

Chunks are fucked

HUD Minimap rotation indicator doesn't work right when pitching the camera

Added coloring for errors, but I'm not sure it works

Added UnrealMovementComponent Actor/Character spawning
	First time you run the game or after hotreload it doesn't spawn anyone
	This seems to have gone away

Added TrackActorLifetime, which is untested
	Is this executed when pending kills will be sitting around, or right after cleanup?

Added EntityPlayerSharedData, which is untested

Added Interact to player, but does not seem to work
