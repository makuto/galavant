Soak test editor - after ~1 hour it was looking pretty glitchy

What does agent component manager do with triggers once plan is done? How to know plan is done?

statics don't work well with hot reloading
	Need some sort of system which makes it easy to tell static shit to reload?

Pickups sort of working, sometimes they aren't picked up, Actors are being destroyed strangely
	Possibility that pickup actor is falling through the floor (invisible other component hitting KillZ?) YES, it's KillZ

Chunks are fucked

DOING

	Is this executed when pending kills will be sitting around, or right after cleanup?

Added Interact to player, but does not seem to work
