# Notes

Miscellaneous notes regarding working on Galavant, the code, and other random shit.

## Working With Unreal

- When making changes to Galavant's libraries, simply touch a GalavantUnreal source file to ensure 
you get the latest Galavant changes when using Unreal's hot reloading

- TODO: Something needs to get done. I use TodoReview for Sublime to find all of these easily. 
- @Performance: Not justifiable as a TODO, but could be looked at when thinking about performance
- @Callback: The marked function is used as a callback. Preferably @Callback [Callback type name]
