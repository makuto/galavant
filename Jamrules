## Compiler arguments

# Galavant requires C++11
#   fPIC = position independent code. This is so the lib can be linked in other libs/executables
#   g = debug symbols
#   lstdc++ = standard library
#   -stdlib=lib++ = Unreal uses libc++, which is busted on Ubuntu 16.04. Remove this option
#      if you don't give a shit about Unreal and/or want to build the tests
#   Og = compile without optimizations for debugging
#   -Wall -Wextra = Error detection/tolerance
#C++FLAGS = -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++ -fPIC -g -Og -Wall -Wextra ; # Required arguments for Unreal
C++FLAGS = -std=c++11 -fPIC -g -Og -Wall -Wextra ;                # Required arguments for tests

# TODO: add project-specific filetype rules for things like flatbuffer .json compilation (see "UserObject rule":
# 	https://swarm.workshop.perforce.com/view/guest/perforce_software/jam/src/Jamfile.html ) ?

# TODO: Add variable that allows user to swap between compiling Unreal
#  and compiling testse on the command line (see above page under "Variables
#  used in Building Executables and Libraries)

# TODO: [Hacked done] Calling jam -dc indicates that it thinks many unmodified files are newer, 
#  which is why it's building way more than it should be. Further investigation is needed, as if it 
#  has nothing to build it should complete almost instantly
#  
#  The problem was Library deletes .o files, preventing Jam from knowing what needs rebuilt
#   (see https://swarm.workshop.perforce.com/view/guest/perforce_software/jam/src/Jambase.html)
#  Actually, because I'm moving libs to lib/, Jam doesn't know to look there for .o
#   (see http://maillist.perforce.com/pipermail/jamming/2004-November/004235.html)
#  Motherfucker seems to be broken no matter fucking what (see src/Jamfile commented lines)
#
#  Update: Something seems fucked with the Library or LibraryFromObjects rules. Instead of diving
#   deeper, I'm going to just add this flag which will guarantee Jam won't rely on reading the libs
#   to find "missing" objects
#  (as an aside, https://swarm.workshop.perforce.com/view/guest/perforce_software/jam/src/Jam.html
#   was helpful, esp 'jam -dx')
