Behavior Trees
====================
- Leaf: Cannot have children
	- Conditional: returns success or failure immediately
	- Action: can return running
- Composite: Has one or more children
	- Parallel: runs multiple children at once
	- Sequence: runs children in order, aborts on child failure
	- Selector: runs children in order, continues on child failure
	- Random: runs one of its children at random
- Decorator: Has exactly one child
	- Inverter
	- Succeeder: always return success
	- Failer: always return failure
	- Repeat X times
	- Repeat until failure
	- Repeat until success

		while there are trees which aren't running and not at max number loops

		tick running nodes
